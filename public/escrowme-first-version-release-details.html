        <p>While you are getting prepare to use Escrowme for the first time, we have been receiving many similar questions from potential users: when will the platform be launched and what are the features you should expect? So, we decided to address some of these concerns ahead of the live stream event by releasing further details today. You can also get a sneak peek at the new UI below.</p>
        <h2>Escrowme Roadmap</h2>
        <p>We also realized from the feedback that the plan for Escrowme may seem like a lot of work all at once. So, we wanted to let you know that we have actually been working on all Escrowme features for many months. We only have about 2 final stages of integration of many of all the features announced… So, here’s what you can expect and when.</p>
        <h2>Escrowme VI- December 2020</h2>
        <p>The first version of Escrowme (aka escrowme.com) will be ready at the end of Q4, 2020, in December. Yes, we realize that just three months away and would like to assure you that this is a development-led decision and has been fully signed off by our developers as an achievable and realistic deadline. Remember, they’ve already been working on many of Escrowme core features for months.The first features coming in V1 include a single login and bitcoin wallet, buy and sell, send and receive. Live chat features for buyers and sellers. Sellers will be able to post offers with any payment method and buyers can buy using any payment method.Many of you asked what cryptocurrencies will be listed when we launch the platform. We will be starting off with BTC while buyers can buy with the following payment methods:<b>PayPal</b>, <b>Cashapp</b>, <b>MTN card</b>, <b>Local bank transfer</b></p>
        <h2>What Other Cryptocurrencies Will We List?</h2>
        <p>Another question that came up a few times. Of course, We already have plenty of plans up our sleeve. We have not been idly watching as we receive lot of suggestions on more features to add. In fact, it is worth mentioning that it will be a huge added opportunities for buyers and sellers to trade on Escrowme if we launch with 2 or more cryptocurrencies. We planned to add one more cryptocurrency by the end of Q2, 2021.</p>
        <h2>Sneak Peak of UI</h2>
        <img class="sneak__peak--ui" src="img/img-2.jpg">
        <p>You can do quite a lot of things from your dashboard after sign in. And as you can see from the image bellow, from December, you will have the ability to use all features from the screenshot of the dashboard bellow.</p>
        <h2>Additional Info</h2>
        <p>All the features on the Escrowme user dashboard will be launched in December and you will be able to transact with your account. We had expected the live chat to be launched in Q1 of next year but we have brought it forward to December. The business partner rating will launch in Q1, 2021, giving users the ability to kick out scammers themselves through rating. What’s more, the upgrade level feature will also launch in Q1, 2021, giving you the ability to increase the amount you can transact with.</p>
